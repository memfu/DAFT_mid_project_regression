# Expanding into Brazil - Where should be located the warehouse for an e-commerce business?

Brazil is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. Since several years Brazil belongs to the nine largest emerging and developing economies. It has around 212 million inhabitants.
All this facts make Brazil a really desirable place to start an e-commerce business. But which is the best strategical location for the warehouse?

The objective of this project is to suggest the best location for an e-commerce warehouse in Brazil, based on the dataset from Olist and another dataset with real estate listings in Brazil during the last decade.

The project has two Jupyter notebooks, one Tableau file, a Powerpoint and a folder with images and gifs :) The datasets were not uploaded because of the size. But feel free to contact me ^^
